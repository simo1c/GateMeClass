GateMeClass (Gate Mining and Classification) is an R tool that simplifies the cell annotation of cytometry data.
It enables both supervised and semi-supervised classification with a strong emphasis on preserving a high degree of biological interpretability through the use of the marker table that can be manually defined or extracted from annotated reference datasets.
